<b>Further Documentation:</b>


This repo contains starter files and scripts for a series of projects for building an IP router in Python.

Two key files:
 * `setup.sh`: a script to setup a directory for running SRPy tests and "real" mininet experiments
 * `start_mininet.py`: a script to build a Mininet topology for running experiments.

Any .srpy files contain serialized test case code.

Documentation:

 * [SRPY documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZT8jKr1vDWsSg12Bf63qcKMxyncIVJGwTLCUY140tWg/edit?usp=sharing)
 * [POX packet library documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3Sn8B1arx8sZOZszcEwx1SWIVBvKyCDAKJOAQOlAtc/edit?usp=sharing)

See [Mininet documentation](http://www.mininet.org) and [POX documentation](https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/ONL/POX+Wiki) for additional reference material.
